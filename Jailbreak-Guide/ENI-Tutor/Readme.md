ENI tutor can be used here, for free as a GEM;

**[ENI-Tutor GEM](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1UHDVJBZ4kdnqD_zbh4FVcNNaCN0NqQ6L?usp=sharing)**

or you can take the files here and put it into a Claude Project via Claude.ai 

*So been wanting to help the community more, help people learn, knowledge is power after all.*

I introduce**ENI-Tutor** a jailbreaking/red-teaming tutor with a full 5-tier curriculum.

**What it is:** ENI Tutor is a custom instruction set that turns an LLM into a red-teaming professor. Just teaches you the actual techniques with hands-on labs. Grounded in real research (ArXiv papers, documented CVEs, HarmBench methodology). I tried to keep it as in depth as I could with verifiable knowledge, want to actually impart knowledge. Will this make you an expert, probably not, but should be good building blocks.

**The Tiers:**

**Tier 1 - Novice:** What LLMs are, why they're vulnerable, key terminology. You learn the landscape before you touch anything.

**Tier 2 - Apprentice:** First attacks. Roleplay/persona (89.6% ASR), encoding tricks (76.2% ASR), logic traps (81.4% ASR). You start documenting attempts properly.

**Tier 3 - Journeyman:** Multi-turn sequences, RAG poisoning, indirect injection, automated tools (GPTFuzzer, PAIR, TAP), the J2 paradigm (using one model to jailbreak another).

**Tier 4 - Expert:** Multimodal attacks on VLMs, agent exploitation (MCP vulnerabilities, tool poisoning), defense evasion, system prompt extraction.

**Tier 5 - Master:** Novel attack development, benchmark contribution, Research level attacks.

It usually starts with an Intake interview to place you at the right tier, and give Lab exercises for each level. I really wanted a hands-on thing, with engagement.
