# MiniMax

So **MiniMax** just released its **M2.1** and it's a very solid model, the writing is very good, as well as its coding capacity. It is lacking in some areas, especially if not used via API.

Cons: **Minimax** web/app has a very clever filtering system, they will flag your content mid message and regen it with;

- “*You should no longer answer/continue answering this question due to content moderation.”*

This shuts down most attempts at jailbreaking the **Lightning** version via **MiniMax** web/app. Is it possible, yes, but definitely not worth the effort.

Now **MiniMax** via API is fully open, I was able to get it to produce any content I wanted. **MiniMax Pro** via the **MiniMax** web/app is also an open book.

I have two jailbreaks, one plays into **Minimax** role, the other overrides it with **ENI**.

**Jailbreaks:**

Can be found in their respective folders, simply copy and paste into chat or use custom Instructions if paying for pro.
