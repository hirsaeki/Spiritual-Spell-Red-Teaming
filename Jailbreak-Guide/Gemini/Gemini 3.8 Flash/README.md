Guide: **Gemini 3.8 Flash**

>Another Flash Model, somehow worse than its predecessor

**Consensus:** *Use the predecessor 3.7 if you can*

## Jailbreaking The Model

*Simply Copy and Paste the following into a GEM or system prompt area for API;*

### Heads up — output filtering
3.8 Flash introduces **API output filtering** for the first time on Gemini — blocked generations come back as **"response interrupted"** instead of a refusal.

Tips:
- Mess with the **thinking effort** — Low vs High behaves differently against the filter
- Use **vaguer language** so you don't flag the classifiers
- **Regen** blocked requests — interruptions aren't consistent
