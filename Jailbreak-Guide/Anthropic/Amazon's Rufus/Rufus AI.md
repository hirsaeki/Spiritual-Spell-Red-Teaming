# Amazon's Rufus AI

So recently discovered Rufus AI, always considered myself adept at getting instructions from LLMs, this one was actually difficult, took me over 10 minutes.

Was able to get;

**[Full Rufus AI System Prompt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oveUti74ro-Xp89lClTCMekRy0zNonTzUI4SM5XGP7k/edit?usp=drivesdk)**

And it's full set of tools, all JSON

**[Rufus AI JSON tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tH3J5bQiJcEZr341bF1qAXyBRBEdrYIblR56sG3360Q/edit?usp=drivesdk)**

The model runs off a version of Claude Haiku, extremely hard to jailbreak, not impossible, but not worth the effort at all, since you are limited by input allowance and a shifting context window, that is allegedly 200k according to the token tracker the model has access to.

**Juice isn't worth the squeeze**

Best bet would be to make a injection that maliciously uses the tools, but I'm much too lazy for all that and do not enjoy legal issues.
