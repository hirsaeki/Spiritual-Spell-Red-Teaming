**Models Actively Supported:**
Jailbreak methods available for almost *any* LLM — but these four are the most powerful and versatile.

---
### 🔥 The BIG Ones:

1. **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
2. **Claude** (Anthropic)
3. **Gemini** (Google)
4. **Grok** (xAI)

These are the **go-to** models for:
- Intelligence
- Advanced Features
- Reliable Jailbreaking Methods

Each of these models can:
- Handle **complex prompts**
- Support **longer tasks**
- Produce **diverse outputs**
More than most others on the current LLM scene.

### Other LLMs - Lesser Known Models

I revamped my former Jailbreak Guide and tested **Every Single Model** on my list

Alternatives to the "Big 4" (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) with varying capabilities, censorship levels, and accessibility. See Other LLMs for the full listing.
